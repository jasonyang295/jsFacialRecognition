# Facial Recognition Project
This project implements a popular facial recognition package, <strong>face-api.js</strong>, and deploys it on your local webcam. Using models I downloaded from [this repo](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Face-Detection-JavaScript), the api scans your face and is able to accurately display your current facial emotion. 

The repo where I sourced the models is also the inspiration of this project! The original creator goes on to make a part two, which associates names with faces. 

## Implementation
Done in js. The actual package is much more advanced (done in tensorflow and has many layers behind it) and we're merely importing it for our own use in this fun project. In order to use this project, clone the repo and run the index.html file with liveserver or some other html live-view extension.
