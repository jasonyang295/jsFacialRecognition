# Facial Recognition Project
This project implements a popular facial recognition package, face-api.js, and deploys it on your local webcam. Using models I downloaded from [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Face-Detection-JavaScript), the api scans your face and is able to accurately display your current facial emotion. Refer to the git repo where I sourced the models for the inspiration of this project. 

## Implementation
Done in js. The actual package is much more advanced (done in tensorflow and has many layers behind it) and we're merely importing it for our own use in this fun project.
